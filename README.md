# HiddenOrderDEX

A Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)–powered decentralized exchange that enables **hidden orders** and **privacy-preserving on-chain trading**.  
In HiddenOrderDEX, users’ orders — including **price, quantity, and even their existence** — remain encrypted at all times. The matching engine operates on ciphertext, ensuring that no participant, miner, or validator can front-run or observe ongoing trades.

## Introduction

Traditional decentralized exchanges (DEXs) face a fundamental privacy and fairness problem.  
While they promise transparency, the open nature of blockchain exposes all pending orders and transactions to the public. This transparency, paradoxically, enables malicious behavior such as:

- **Front-running:** Attackers reorder transactions to profit from visible trades.  
- **Sandwich attacks:** Bots manipulate prices by placing orders before and after a visible transaction.  
- **Information leakage:** Competitors can infer market sentiment or strategies by observing pending orders.  

HiddenOrderDEX introduces **a new cryptographic layer of confidentiality** using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**.  
With FHE, trades can be matched **without revealing any information** about price, quantity, or order status — not even to validators or other users.

---

## Core Idea

In traditional DEXs, every order is visible on-chain.  
In HiddenOrderDEX, orders are encrypted at submission, and **the matching process itself is performed over encrypted data**.  

Using FHE, the system can:

- Compare encrypted prices to determine trade compatibility  
- Match encrypted bids and asks  
- Execute settlement while preserving complete order secrecy  

All computations happen on ciphertexts, and only the final executed trade (after decryption by authorized keys) is revealed.

## Why FHE Matters

Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows arbitrary computations on encrypted data without decryption.  
This is revolutionary for decentralized trading because it:

1. **Protects Trade Intent:** Neither validators nor smart contracts can infer user strategies.  
2. **Prevents Front-running:** Since order information is hidden, no one can act before you.  
3. **Eliminates MEV (Maximal Extractable Value):** Miners and bots cannot exploit transaction ordering.  
4. **Enables True On-Chain Privacy:** The blockchain can perform matching without ever exposing sensitive details.  

Without FHE, these guarantees are impossible — even advanced zero-knowledge proofs cannot completely hide order existence and logic flow during matching.

## Features

### Hidden Orders
- Orders are encrypted at the client side using FHE.  
- Both **order content** and **existence** remain invisible on-chain until settlement.  

### Encrypted Matching
- Matching logic runs entirely in the encrypted domain.  
- Price and quantity comparisons are performed without decryption.  

### Privacy-First Settlement
- Only matched trades are revealed in minimal form for settlement.  
- The rest of the order book remains private, even to smart contracts.  

### Front-running Immunity
- No visible pending orders, so no opportunity for manipulation.  

### Secure Fairness
- Matching is deterministic and verifiable through cryptographic proofs.  

### Scalability-Aware Design
- Batch matching supports multiple encrypted orders simultaneously using parallelized FHE circuits.

## System Architecture

HiddenOrderDEX introduces a hybrid architecture combining **on-chain verification** and **off-chain encrypted computation**.

### Components

1. **Client Layer**
   - Encrypts orders using user-specific FHE keys.  
   - Signs and submits ciphertext orders to the network.  

2. **Encrypted Matching Engine**
   - Operates as a decentralized node network.  
   - Executes FHE-based comparison and matching circuits.  
   - Produces encrypted trade outcomes and encrypted proofs.  

3. **Settlement Contract**
   - Decrypts minimal outputs needed for settlement (e.g., matched pair IDs).  
   - Executes transfers through standard token contracts.  

4. **Audit & Verification Module**
   - Ensures FHE computations follow deterministic, auditable logic.  
   - Generates proof-of-correctness for off-chain encrypted computation.  

---

## Workflow Overview

1. **Order Creation:**  
   User encrypts price, quantity, and order type using their FHE key.  

2. **Order Submission:**  
   The encrypted order is transmitted to the matching network.  

3. **Encrypted Matching:**  
   Matching engine runs FHE algorithms to find compatible buy/sell pairs.  

4. **Settlement Preparation:**  
   Only matched orders produce decryptable results.  

5. **Final Settlement:**  
   Smart contract finalizes the trade while maintaining total order privacy.

## Example Scenario

Imagine Alice and Bob each submit orders to HiddenOrderDEX:

- Alice wants to buy 2 ETH at $2500  
- Bob wants to sell 2 ETH at $2500  

Both orders are encrypted using FHE.  
The matching engine never sees these values in plaintext but still determines compatibility via encrypted comparisons.  
Once a match is found, only the **resulting trade execution** is revealed for token settlement — price, identity, and order size remain undisclosed to anyone else.

---

## Security Principles

1. **No Plaintext Exposure:**  
   Order data never appears in plaintext, even during computation.  

2. **End-to-End Encryption:**  
   Data is encrypted at the source and remains so until cryptographically proven settlement.  

3. **Unlinkability:**  
   Encrypted orders cannot be correlated with users or wallets.  

4. **Zero Information Leakage:**  
   Observers cannot infer whether a user even placed an order.  

5. **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography:**  
   FHE parameters are chosen for post-quantum security.  

6. **Auditability Without Compromise:**  
   The protocol offers verifiable computation proofs ensuring correctness of encrypted matching.  

---

## Technology Stack

- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (for encrypted settlement and verification logic)  
- **Matching Engine:** Rust + C++ for high-performance encrypted computation  
- **Encryption Layer:** FHE libraries such as SEAL or Concrete for ciphertext operations  
- **Frontend:** TypeScript + React for secure user interaction and order submission  
- **Storage:** Off-chain encrypted message pools with verifiable integrity proofs  

---

## Design Highlights

- **Latency Optimization:**  
  The system uses approximate ciphertext batching for near real-time matching speed.  

- **Gas Efficiency:**  
  Only essential encrypted commitments are recorded on-chain, reducing costs.  

- **Composability:**  
  HiddenOrderDEX is designed to integrate with existing DeFi protocols while preserving encrypted data flow.  

- **Adaptive Privacy Levels:**  
  Traders can choose between fully hidden and semi-private modes depending on liquidity preferences.
